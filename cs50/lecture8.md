## HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Internet is network of networks

Simple explanation:
Internet -> Routers -> Computer

Internet data can take many "paths" to find the server

Protocol = convention

TCP/IP = Protocol to get data from point A to B

Packets are like a envelope to send information from a computer to another

Package(Build Data Create Packages) -> Router(Resolve DNS, IP...) -> Server (Read TCP, HTTP...)

TCP Allows server to do multiple things based on ports

IP = Internet Protocol

DNS = Domain Name System (Convert names to IP)

ISP = Internet Service Provider

TCP = Transfer Control Protocol

PORT = Wich Port each service can use

HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (GET, POST...)

URL = Uniform Resource Locator

TCP is outside of "envelop" and HTTP it's own content. TCP define addresses and where envelope needs to go, HTTP is thei information.

DOM is a Tree structure interpreted by browsers.

HTML are absed with open/close tags with many responsabilites.

CSS is a Cascading Style Sheets is used to style your page using properties

JavaScript allow page to be more flexible. And allow you to run code on client computer.

With JavaScript we have a programming language that allows us to change DOM Tree

### Internet Primer

Internet works like a big chunks of cable connecting peoples

IP is a unical address provided for each device, actually world is changing to IPV6 that is a 8 cluster in hexadecimal that give a number for a device.

DHCP server gives you a unique IP address comming from internet

DNS translate IPs to readable words for humans, so that humans can use it. DNS holders administrate a bunch of DNS like a library of yellow pages.

Access points, instead of each device has a IP, how hold my IP is a router (access point), that manage this IP for me. Usually today home networks consists of access points that combine a router, a modem, a switch, and other technologis together into a single device.

### IP

The Internet Protocol has the responsibility to know how to communicate with each device in that interconnected network.

Connections are handled by routers to reduce cost, each router sends your connection to another router until you get the point you want.

IP is responsible to get information from point A to point B and breaking this information into small to send small packages via the internet.


### TCP

Transmition Control Protocol
