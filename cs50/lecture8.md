Internet is network of networks

Simple explanation:
Internet -> Routers -> Computer

Internet data can take many "paths" to find the server

Protocol = convention

TCP/IP = Protocol to get data from point A to B

Packets are like a envelope to send information from a computer to another

Package(Build Data Create Packages) -> Router(Resolve DNS, IP...) -> Server (Read TCP, HTTP...)

TCP Allows server to do multiple things based on ports

IP = Internet Protocol

DNS = Domain Name System (Convert names to IP)

ISP = Internet Service Provider

TCP = Transfer Control Protocol

PORT = Wich Port each service can use

HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (GET, POST...)

URL = Uniform Resource Locator

TCP is outside of "envelop" and HTTP it's own content. TCP define addresses and where envelope needs to go, HTTP is thei information.

DOM is a Tree structure interpreted by browsers.
