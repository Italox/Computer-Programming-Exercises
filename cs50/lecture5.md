## Data Structures

Data structure is a way to retain information into your program "memory" and organize that you can access when calculing. Usually data structures try to balance costs to access/manipulate some block of data.

malloc and array is primarly equal because both allocate chunk of memory

Array: Good for indexes and fast access position, is a piece ou memory previously allocated and addressed

Linked list: Different address of memory linked by their pointer. List give dynamism but you lost index access and some type of searchs.

list = null
list -> next -> node

node -> number = 1

node -> next = null

n->number
n->pointer

Tree: In a tree you have a root that is your entry point inyo the list and usually two nodes, left/right, both pointing to smaller/greather values that you can follow in some search for example.

Some type of structure that you can display a array in a similar bidimensional data structure to access data in a differente way, acessing like pointers into lists.

Hash table: Is a data structure that combine a linked list and a array inside of it. You need to be cautious about colisions in hash table, it's easy to mess up some data colision and crete unbalanced structure.

Tries: Some data structure than sacrifice memory to gain running time, creating a array meshed with a tree linking each value in a root nodes.

Queues: First In, First Out. FIFO.

Stacks: LIFO. Last in, First out.

Push is add a element into a structure. Pop is remove a element.

Dictionarie: Is a abstraction of a hash table. Key and values to map one thing to another.
